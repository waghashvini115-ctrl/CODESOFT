In this task, I have worked on the Iris Flower Classification problem.
The Iris dataset contains three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Using sepal and petal measurements, I performed data preprocessing,
trained a machine learning classification model, and evaluated its performance.
The model successfully classifies iris flowers into their respective species.
